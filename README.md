## What is SafePass?

SafePass is a simple SwiftUI based password generator app that creates a custom password.

## Description

The password generator creates custom passwords based on user preferences, including or excluding uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters via two toggles on the main view. When the generate button is clicked, the app switches to a new view displaying the generated password. By default, with both toggles off, it generates a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. Clicking the generated password copies it to the clipboard for use anywhere.
